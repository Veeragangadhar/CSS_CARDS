                <h3>Flats</h3>
                <p>One-bedroom apartments consist of a separate bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom. They offer more privacy and space compared to studio apartments, making them suitable for couples and small families. These apartments strike a balance between affordability and comfort. They often come with basic amenities such as a balcony or a small garden space, providing a more comfortable living experience. One-bedroom apartments are a popular choice for those looking to move up from a studio while still managing rental costs. However, they do come with higher rent and utility costs compared to studios, and the space might still be limited for larger families.</p>
